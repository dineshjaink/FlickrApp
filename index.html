      <p>Tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Fix so the design of the images is like the attached picture in the root folder (preview.jpg)</li>
<li>  Implement so you can click on the Share link and retrieve a full page that is SEO friendly</li>
<li>  Style the share link so that it looks like the button in the preview</li>
<li>  Add some kind of status when the AJAX is running, something like "Requesting, Retrieving"</li>
<li>  Display whatever the pictures are retrieved from the cache or not, like "Loaded from cache / Loaded from flickr"</li>
<li>  Implement so the cache helper (CacheHelper.cs) has support for both reference types and value types</li>
<li>  In HomeController, add a feature so you can select between FlickrCacheableRepository or FlickrRepository by some configuration flag, create a solution that are easy to extend so you can have N numbers of repositories</li>
<li>  Change HomeController's GetImage method only to allow POST request, update the JavaScript so the functionality still work</li>
<li>  New images should fade in when they are added to the DOM, focus only on the image so each of the images loads smoothly and are display ready.</li>
<li>  Style the application to look like the attached preview (background image found in the root of the Demo folder)</li>
<li>  Create a responsive layout so that the application looks good in all resolutions (1 image per row in mobile, 5 on tablet and 10 on high resolution computers)</li>
</ul>

<p>Completed Tasks:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Styling: </p>

<ul>
<li>Styling of the Page as per the attached preview. Used bootstrap and custom styling to give it the look and feel as required.</li>
<li>Responsive layout handled and that the application looks good.</li>
<li>Click on images, enlarge them and also navigate without going back to the application.</li>
<li>Added a loader when the search is being triggered until the images gets listed.</li>
<li>Dynamic HTML and stylesheet when images are received from Flickr API.</li>
<li>Using jQuery Fancy box library for enlarging the image on click of it.</li>
<li>Share Button can be nade SEO friendly, bot implemented as part of this.</li>
<li>Spinner loads whenever the images are being retrieved.</li>
<li>Image fading as part of Fancy Box used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repository Selection:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implemented the feature of selecting the repository using the design pattern - Dependency Injection.</li>
<li>Used Unity.Mvc4 for injecting and resolving the dependencies.</li>
<li>The dependencies are configured in the web.config, which makes the change of repository when required easier.
eg:
 </li>
<li>Modified the controller so that repository dependencies can be injected and can be used.</li>
<li>The same dependecies can be injected from the bootstrapper code. 
Eg below:
container.RegisterType();</li>
<li>This feature is extendable and any repositories can be injected and used on run time. No / Minimal code change is required.</li>
<li>This pattern can also be implemented with different Libraries that are available for dependency injection like AutoFacade.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Controller Changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Decorated the Home Controller with HttpPost attribute, so that it only allows POST request.</li>
<li>Modified the Ajax call to do a POST request instead of GET.<br>
</li>
<li>Bundled all the css and JavaScripts required as part of BundleConfig.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>CacheHelper:</p>

<ul>
<li>CacheHelper can be modified from using HttpCache to memory cache, not implemented as part of this assignment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

<ul>
<li>Tested the application in IISExpress that comes part of Visual Studio.</li>
<li>Hosted the application in localhost and verified that minification of JavaScript and CSS happens.</li>
